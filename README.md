The Blood Donation Application is a vital tool designed to facilitate blood donations, connecting donors and recipients efficiently. This project features three core modules: Admin, Donor, and Recipient, each playing a distinct role in the blood donation process. The application is built using Java (JDBC), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Bootstrap technologies, hosted on an Apache Tomcat server, ensuring a 
user-friendly and secure environment for blood donation coordination.

Admin Module:

The Admin module serves as the central authority responsible for managing blood donation requests. Admin is responsible for accepting or rejecting requests for blood donations. Additionally, if any potential donors are not registered on the application, they can approach the admin to have their details added. Admin plays a pivotal role in maintaining and updating the donor and recipient database, ensuring the efficient functioning of the system.

Donor Module:

The Donor module provides a platform for users to register and log in to the application, offering their willingness to donate blood. Donors can browse and respond to active blood donation requests displayed on the platform, directly offering their assistance to recipients in need. The donor's details and donation history are stored in the system, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Recipient Module:

The Recipient module enables individuals in need of blood to register and log in to the application, posting their blood donation requests. They can search for available blood donors and, if needed, send direct requests to potential donors. If the required blood is unavailable, recipients have the option to post a public request, making it visible to all donors. This module allows for timely and efficient coordination between recipients and donors.


The Blood Donation Application leverages Java (JDBC), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Bootstrap technologies to create a user-friendly, accessible, and secure platform for blood donation coordination. Hosted on an Apache Tomcat server, it ensures reliable and efficient access for users. The project aims to streamline the process of blood donation, providing a robust tool for administrators, donors, and recipients to connect and save lives. This application is a valuable asset in promoting the timely and effective availability of blood for those in need.
